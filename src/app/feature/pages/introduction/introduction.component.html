              Holding an M.Sc. and having several years of professional experience, I am thrilled to pursue higher academic achievements by applying Ph.D. program. In the following paragraphs, I will elaborate on my professional and academic background. <br>
              Kurds are considered an ethnic minority in Iran, deprived of many rights and developments. Growing up as a Kurdish woman, I faced significant obstacles in achieving my goals due to the discrimination against my ethnicity. Every step I took required an immense amount of effort and determination. However, this hardship did not hold me back but fueled my passion and perseverance throughout my journey. <br>

              In 2009, I entered Ilam University to study Business Administration, during which I was particularly interested in the “Procurement, Warehousing and Distribution System” and “Marketing Research” courses. They acquainted me with the role of procurement management in commercial and manufacturing organizations and the importance of improved strategies, accurate pricing, and proper settings for product supplies in optimizing costs. Thanks to my outstanding performance, I scored 19.25/20 and 18.5/20 in these courses, respectively. During my BSc, I not only had to adjust to the new university lifestyle but also worked as an Administrative Officer in a medical clinic to cover my financial expenses. My bachelor journey was incredibly beneficial, as it introduced me to the fundamentals of business, management, and marketing. This experience motivated me to pursue a Master's degree in Business Administration. <br>

              Shortly after graduation, I joined the Business Administration-Marketing M.Sc. program at the Islamic Azad University Tehran North Branch. During my master’s period, the “Advanced Strategic Management” and “Industrial Marketing” courses especially fascinated me. My interest in the Advanced Strategic Management course is mostly because of my curiosity about general strategies, SWOT analysis, and the hierarchy and different levels of strategic management resulting in the organizations’ sustainability. I am pleased to have achieved a 19.5/20 score in this course. Moreover, the Industrial Marketing course introduced me to market segmentation and large-scale demand estimation, sparking my interest in industrial marketing strategies for global markets. Through my excellent performance in this course, I achieved a perfect 20/20 score. The knowledge I acquired from these courses proved beneficial when I started working on my thesis, "The study of brand trust mediator role in the relationship between perceived value, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty: A case study of Melli Banks in Tehran.” We have seen in past research that keeping customers loyal to the bank is as important as attracting capital. They have shown that to attract capital, the banks must attract customers, keep them satisfied, and gain their trust to ensure their loyalty to the organization. The results of my thesis show the positive impact of perceived value and customer satisfaction on brand loyalty, resulting in a meaningful and positive effect on brand trust. Completing my master’s provided me with a strong foundation, preparing me for future academic pursuits. <br>

              During my master’s period, I got an incredible opportunity to work as a Foreign Commercial Expert in the Novin Tarkhis Baghi Company, which enabled me to practice my academic knowledge in the real world.

During this time, I have taken on numerous responsibilities, such as international negotiations, marketing, sourcing and outsourcing, and importation.

Additionally, I have consistently tried to update my knowledge by attending numerous workshops and conferences in my field. In order to achieve my academic aspirations, I took on the challenge of preparing for the GRE and TOEFL exams. While staying on track with my goals, balancing a demanding job that requires a considerable amount of time and energy is challenging. However, my efforts paid off, and I passed the GRE and TOEFL exams with overall 322 and 106 scores, respectively. Specifically, my GRE percentiles are 65 in Verbal Reasoning, 83 in Quantitative Reasoning, and 56 in Analytical Writing.
