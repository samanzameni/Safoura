              Kurds are considered an ethnic minority in Iran, deprived of many rights and developments. Growing up as a Kurdish woman, I faced significant obstacles in achieving my goals due to the discrimination against my ethnicity. Every step I took required an immense amount of effort and determination. However, this hardship did not hold me back but fueled my passion and perseverance throughout my journey.

              In 2009, I entered Ilam University to study Business Administration, during which I was particularly interested in the “Procurement, Warehousing and Distribution System” and “Fundamentals of Organization and Management” courses. The Procurement, Warehousing, and Distribution System course introduced me to the crucial role of procurement management in both commercial and manufacturing organizations. Moreover, I was interested in the Fundamentals of Organization and Management course as it acquainted me with influential management scholars and the challenges managers encounter.  Thanks to my outstanding performance, I scored 19.25/20 and 17.5/20 in these courses, respectively. My bachelor journey was incredibly beneficial, as it introduced me to the fundamentals of business and management. This experience motivated me to pursue a Master's degree in Business Administration.

              Shortly after graduation, I joined the Business Administration-Marketing M.Sc. program at the Islamic Azad University Tehran North Branch. During my master’s period, the “Advanced Management Theories” and “Industrial Marketing” courses especially fascinated me. The Advanced Management Theories course offered me a holistic view of management, leadership, creativity, innovation, and organizational behavior. Moreover, the Industrial Marketing course introduced me to market segmentation and large-scale demand estimation, sparking my interest in industrial marketing strategies for global markets. I excelled in these courses, achieving perfect 20/20 scores in both of them. The knowledge I acquired from these courses proved beneficial when I started working on my thesis, "The study of brand trust mediator role in the relationship between perceived value, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty”. The results of my thesis show the positive impact of perceived value and customer satisfaction on brand loyalty, resulting in a meaningful and positive effect on brand trust. Completing my master’s provided me with a strong foundation, preparing me for future academic pursuits.

              After my master’s period, I got an incredible opportunity to work as a Commercial and Administrative Expert in the Novin Tarkhis Baghi Company, which enabled me to practice my academic knowledge in the real world. I have spent 7 years working in the Foreign Trade departments of various esteemed organizations. During this time, I have taken on numerous responsibilities, such as international negotiations, marketing, sourcing and outsourcing, and importation. As a senior professional, I have had the privilege of instructing junior staff for the past two years, showcasing my mentorship abilities. Additionally, I have consistently tried to update my knowledge by attending numerous workshops and conferences in my field. In order to achieve my academic aspirations, I took on the challenge of preparing for the GRE and TOEFL exams. While staying on track with my goals, balancing a demanding job that requires a considerable amount of time and energy is challenging. However, my efforts paid off, and I passed the GRE and TOEFL exams with overall 322 and 106 scores, respectively. Specifically, my GRE percentiles are 65 in Verbal Reasoning, 83 in Quantitative Reasoning, and 56 in Analytical Writing. My professional journey has sharpened my analytical and problem-solving skills by exposing me to the challenges and opportunities of business and the global market. Moreover, my ability to manage international communications with foreign companies highlights my interpersonal skills and ability to handle complex situations.
