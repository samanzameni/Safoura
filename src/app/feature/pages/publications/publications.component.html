            <p style="text-align: justify">
              This study delves into the impact of perceived value and customer satisfaction on brand loyalty within the context of the National Bank of Iran, while also examining the mediating role of brand trust in these relationships. Categorized as applied and survey research, this study focuses on customers frequenting National Bank branches in Tehran’s first district. A sample of 385 individuals, selected through the Krejcie and Morgan table, participated in the study. Data collection was conducted using a combination of cluster and non-random sampling methods through questionnaires, with the reliability of the questionnaire assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. The study reveals a significant positive influence of perceived value and customer satisfaction on brand loyalty and brand trust, with brand loyalty reciprocally reinforcing brand trust. This research sheds light on the intricate dynamics between perceived value, customer satisfaction, brand loyalty, and brand trust in the banking industry. It emphasizes the critical role of customer perceptions in brand building and highlights the interconnectedness of these factors in influencing customer relationships and brand reputation.
