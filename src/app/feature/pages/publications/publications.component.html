            <b>Abstract</b><br>
            Strong brand names not only create a competitive advantage but also enhance the organization's liquidity, accelerate cash flow, and have the potential to increase pricing, profitability, and customer loyalty. Understanding the factors that influence a strong brand name is crucial. Among these factors, perceived value and customer satisfaction play a significant role in fostering brand loyalty. Due to the limited research on the correlation between these variables, this study aims to explore the impact of perceived value and customer satisfaction on brand loyalty. The research also delves into the mediating role of brand trust, examining how it affects the relationship between perceived value, customer satisfaction, and brand loyalty.

            The present study falls under the category of applied and survey research. The statistical population for this research consists of customers who frequent National Bank branches in the first district of Tehran. Due to the vast population, a sample size of 385 individuals was selected using the Karjesi and Morgan table. Sampling was carried out using a combination of cluster and non-random methods, with data collection being conducted through questionnaires. A standardized questionnaire, previously utilized in a similar study, was employed in this research. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed by calculating Kornbach's alpha, while its validity was confirmed by experts, supervisors, and advisors. The results indicate that perceived value and customer satisfaction both have a positive and significant impact on brand loyalty and trust. Furthermore, brand loyalty was found to have a positive and significant influence on brand trust. Finally, based on the outcomes, research recommendations were put forward.
